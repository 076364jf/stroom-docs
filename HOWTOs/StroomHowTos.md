# Stroom HOWTOs

This is a series of *HOWTOs* that are designed to get one started with Stroom. The *HOWTOs* are broken down into different functional concepts or areas of Stroom.

**NOTE:** These *HOWTOs* will match the development of Stroom and as a result, various elements will be updated over time, including screen captures.
In some instances, screen captures will contain timestamps and so you may note inconsistent date or time movements within a complete HOWTO,
although if a sequence of captures is contained within a section of a document, they all will be replaced.

## Installation

The [Installation Scenarios](Install/InstallHowTo.md "Stroom Installation Deployments") HOWTO is provided to assist users in setting up a number
of different Stroom deployments.
