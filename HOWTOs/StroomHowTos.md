## Installation and initial configuration of Stroom

This series of *HOWTOs* is designed to get simple or somewhat more complicated scenarios of Stroom deployments installed and configured.

  - [Single Node Install](series01/StroomHowTo-1.00-a.md "Single Node Stroom Installation") for a simple environment.
  - [Forwarding Proxy Install](series01/StroomHowTo-1.10-a.md "Forwarding Stroom Proxy Installation") for when one has a extensive network where one wants to aggregate data through a proxy before sending data to the central Stroom processing systems.
  - [Standalone Proxy Install](series01/StroomHowTo-1.20-a.md "Standalone Stroom Proxy Installation") for when one has disconnected networks where collected data can be manually transferred to a Stroom processing service.
  - [Single Node, Separate Database Node Install](series01/StroomHowTo-1.30-a.md "Single Node, Separate Database Node Installation") to separate the database from the Stroom processing server.
  - [Multiple Node, Separate Database Node Install](series01/StroomHowTo-1.40-a.md "Multiple Node, Separate Database Node Stroom  Installation") for a more complex environment when multiple nodes are required to handle the data processing load.
  - [Multiple Node, Adding a New Processing Node](series01/StroomHowTo-1.50-a.md "Multiple Node, addition of Processing Node") for a more complex environment when multiple nodes are required to handle the data processing load and one needs to add a new processing node.
  - [Stroom User Interface - Initial Configuration](series01/StroomHowTo-1.60-a.md "Initial configuration of the Stroom system via the User Interface") to allow a user to complete the installation process for a Stroom deployment and ready it for receiving and storing data.
